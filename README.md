## Bootstrap
Bootstrap is a free and open-source front-end framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites and web applications.


## Responsive Grid System: 
Bootstrap provides a responsive grid system based on a 12-column layout, which allows developers to create layouts that adapt to various screen sizes and devices. It makes use of CSS media queries to adjust the layout and styling accordingly.

## Pre-designed Components:
Bootstrap includes a wide range of pre-designed UI components, such as buttons, forms, navigation bars, dropdowns, alerts, modals, and more. These components are styled and ready to use out of the box, saving developers time and effort in building common interface elements.

## CSS Flexbox and Grid Utilities: 
Bootstrap utilizes CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid utilities to provide additional layout and alignment options. Developers can easily apply utility classes to elements to control their positioning, sizing, and spacing within the layout.
